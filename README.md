# Mini Password Checker

A tiny Python project to practice GitHub teamwork:
branches → commits → pull requests → merge → tests → VS Code.

## Team
- Owner: luqman-codes
- Developer: luqmanqazi961-beep

## Rules
- main is protected (no direct work by developer)
- developer works on feature branches
- all changes come via Pull Requests

## Structure
- src/   -> app code
- tests/ -> unit tests
